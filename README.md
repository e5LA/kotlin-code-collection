# Kotlin Code Collection

This project is a collection of practical, **idiomatic Kotlin code**, including utilities, real-world code snippets, algorithms, and design patterns.

The goal is to keep everything clean, understandable, and useful. This repo uses the **latest stable version of Kotlin**, and embraces the language’s modern features.

Whether you're exploring Kotlin, coming from Java, or just need quick references - this project aims to be a helpful resource.

## 📦 Project Structure

All code is grouped by the purpose:

- [`snippets/`](src/main/kotlin/codecollection/snippets) - small, reusable functions (e.g., capitalize string, check even)
- [`algorithms/`](src/main/kotlin/codecollection/algorithms) - classic CS problems (e.g., binary search, recursion)
- [`kotlinfeatures/`](src/main/kotlin/codecollection/kotlinfeatures) - Kotlin-specific concepts and language demos

[//]: # (- [`patterns/`]&#40;src/main/kotlin/codecollection/patterns&#41; - common design patterns written idiomatically)
