# ‚ö° Kotlin Code Snippets

This package contains a collection of practical, reusable, and idiomatic Kotlin snippets.

Each snippet solves a focused task - from string manipulation to working with numbers, collections, dates, or the system.  

Snippets are organized by category, and each is implemented in a self-contained `.kt` file with corresponding tests.
