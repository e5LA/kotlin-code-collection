# 🧠 Algorithms in Kotlin

This folder contains classic and practical algorithms written in **idiomatic Kotlin**.  

Each algorithm lives in its own file and is tested with a corresponding unit test — keeping the code clean, minimal, and easy to understand.

Whether you're learning, referencing, or contributing — this collection is for you.
