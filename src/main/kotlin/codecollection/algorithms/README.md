# üß† Algorithms in Kotlin

This package contains classic and practical algorithms written in **idiomatic Kotlin**.

Each algorithm is implemented in its own file and is tested with a corresponding unit test - keeping the code clean, minimal, and easy to understand.

Whether you're learning, referencing, or contributing - this collection is for you.
